# /understand-dashboard

Start the Understand Anything dashboard to visualize the knowledge graph for the current project.

## Instructions

1. Determine the project directory:
   - If `$ARGUMENTS` contains a path, use that as the project directory
   - Otherwise, use the current working directory

2. Check that the project directory has analyzable data. Use the artifact validator for knowledge-graph.json, and fall back to existence checks for other artifacts:
   ```bash
   VALIDATOR="<SKILL_DIR>/../understand/validate-artifact.mjs"
   KG_VALID=false
   if node "$VALIDATOR" .understand-anything/knowledge-graph.json knowledge-graph:complete >/dev/null 2>&1; then
     KG_VALID=true
   elif node "$VALIDATOR" .understand-anything/knowledge-graph.json knowledge-graph:scan-only >/dev/null 2>&1; then
     KG_VALID=true
   fi
   ```
   Accept ANY of these:
   - `KG_VALID=true` — single-service mode (knowledge graph is complete)
   - `.understand-anything/system-graph.json` exists — multi-service mode (parent directory with child services)
   - `.understand-anything/wiki/meta.json` exists — wiki-only mode (parent or single service)

   If none are available, tell the user:
   ```
   No knowledge graph or system graph found. Run /understand (single service) or /understand-wiki --batch (multi-service) first.
   ```

3. Find the dashboard code. The dashboard is at `packages/dashboard/` relative to this plugin's root directory. Check these paths in order and use the first that exists:
   - `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/packages/dashboard/` (Claude Code runtime root, highest priority)
   - `~/.understand-anything-plugin/packages/dashboard/` (universal symlink, all installs)
   - Two levels up from `~/.agents/skills/understand-dashboard` real path (self-relative fallback)
   - Two levels up from `~/.copilot/skills/understand-dashboard` real path (Copilot personal skills fallback)
   - Common clone-based install roots:
     - `~/.codex/understand-anything/understand-anything-plugin/packages/dashboard/`
     - `~/.opencode/understand-anything/understand-anything-plugin/packages/dashboard/`
     - `~/.pi/understand-anything/understand-anything-plugin/packages/dashboard/`
     - `~/understand-anything/understand-anything-plugin/packages/dashboard/`

   Use the Bash tool to resolve:
   ```bash
   SKILL_REAL=$(realpath ~/.agents/skills/understand-dashboard 2>/dev/null || readlink -f ~/.agents/skills/understand-dashboard 2>/dev/null || echo "")
   SELF_RELATIVE=$([ -n "$SKILL_REAL" ] && cd "$SKILL_REAL/../.." 2>/dev/null && pwd || echo "")
   COPILOT_SKILL_REAL=$(realpath ~/.copilot/skills/understand-dashboard 2>/dev/null || readlink -f ~/.copilot/skills/understand-dashboard 2>/dev/null || echo "")
   COPILOT_SELF_RELATIVE=$([ -n "$COPILOT_SKILL_REAL" ] && cd "$COPILOT_SKILL_REAL/../.." 2>/dev/null && pwd || echo "")

   PLUGIN_ROOT=""
   for candidate in \
     "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}" \
     "$HOME/.understand-anything-plugin" \
     "$SELF_RELATIVE" \
     "$COPILOT_SELF_RELATIVE" \
     "$HOME/.codex/understand-anything/understand-anything-plugin" \
     "$HOME/.opencode/understand-anything/understand-anything-plugin" \
     "$HOME/.pi/understand-anything/understand-anything-plugin" \
     "$HOME/understand-anything/understand-anything-plugin"; do
     if [ -n "$candidate" ] && [ -d "$candidate/packages/dashboard" ]; then
       PLUGIN_ROOT="$candidate"; break
     fi
   done

   if [ -z "$PLUGIN_ROOT" ]; then
     echo "Error: Cannot find the understand-anything plugin root."
     echo "Checked:"
     echo "  - ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-<unset CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT>}"
     echo "  - $HOME/.understand-anything-plugin"
     echo "  - ${SELF_RELATIVE:-<unresolved path derived from ~/.agents/skills/understand-dashboard>}"
     echo "  - ${COPILOT_SELF_RELATIVE:-<unresolved path derived from ~/.copilot/skills/understand-dashboard>}"
     echo "  - $HOME/.codex/understand-anything/understand-anything-plugin"
     echo "  - $HOME/.opencode/understand-anything/understand-anything-plugin"
     echo "  - $HOME/.pi/understand-anything/understand-anything-plugin"
     echo "  - $HOME/understand-anything/understand-anything-plugin"
     echo "Make sure you followed the installation instructions for your platform."
     exit 1
   fi
   ```

4. Install dependencies and build if needed:
   ```bash
   cd <dashboard-dir> && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile 2>/dev/null || pnpm install
   ```
   Then ensure the core package is built (the dashboard depends on it):
   ```bash
   cd <plugin-root> && pnpm --filter @understand-anything/core build
   ```

5. Start the Vite dev server pointing at the project's knowledge graph:
   ```bash
   cd <dashboard-dir> && GRAPH_DIR=<project-dir> npx vite --host 0.0.0.0
   ```
   Run this in the background so the user can continue working.

6. **Capture the access token URL from the server output.** The Vite server prints lines like:
   ```
   🔑  Dashboard URL (local):   http://127.0.0.1:<PORT>?token=<TOKEN>
   🔑  Dashboard URL (network): http://0.0.0.0:<PORT>?token=<TOKEN>
   ```
   Extract the full URL including the `?token=` parameter. The token is required to access the knowledge graph data — without it the dashboard will show an "Access Token Required" gate.

7. Report to the user, including the full tokenized URL:
   ```
   Dashboard started!
   Local:   http://127.0.0.1:<PORT>?token=<TOKEN>
   Network: http://0.0.0.0:<PORT>?token=<TOKEN>
   Data:    <project-dir>/.understand-anything/

   The dashboard is running in the background. Press Ctrl+C in the terminal to stop it.
   ```
   **Important:** Always include the `?token=` parameter in the URL you share. If you omit it, the user will be blocked by the token gate and have to manually find the token in the terminal output.

## Notes

- The dashboard binds to `0.0.0.0` by default, accessible from external networks via the host's IP address
- The dashboard auto-opens in the default browser via `--open`
- If port 5173 is already in use, Vite will pick the next available port
- The `GRAPH_DIR` environment variable tells the dashboard where to find the knowledge graph
