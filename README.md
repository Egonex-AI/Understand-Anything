> [!TIP]
> **A huge thank you to the community!** The support for Understand-Anything has been incredible. If this tool saves you a few minutes of digging through complexity, that's all I wanted. 🚀

**You just joined a new team. The codebase is 200,000 lines of code. Where do you even start?**

Understand Anything is a [Claude Code Plugin](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins-reference#plugins-reference) that analyzes your project with a multi-agent pipeline, builds a knowledge graph of every file, function, class, and dependency, then gives you an interactive dashboard to explore it all visually. Stop reading code blind. Start seeing the big picture.

> **Graphs that teach > graphs that impress.**

## ✨ Features

> [!NOTE]
> **Want to skip the reading?** Try the [live demo](https://understand-anything.com/demo/) in our [homepage](https://understand-anything.com/) — a fully interactive dashboard you can pan, zoom, search, and explore right in your browser.

### Explore the structural graph

Navigate your codebase as an interactive knowledge graph — every file, function, and class is a node you can click, search, and explore. Select any node to see plain-English summaries, relationships, and guided tours.

</p>

### Understand business logic

Switch to the domain view and see how your code maps to real business processes — domains, flows, and steps laid out as a horizontal graph.

</p>

### Analyze knowledge bases

Point `/understand-knowledge` at a [Karpathy-pattern LLM wiki](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f) and get a force-directed knowledge graph with community clustering. The deterministic parser extracts wikilinks and categories from `index.md`, then LLM agents discover implicit relationships, extract entities, and surface claims — turning your wiki into a navigable graph of interconnected ideas.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install the plugin

```bash
/plugin marketplace add Lum1104/Understand-Anything
/plugin install understand-anything
```

### 2. Analyze your codebase

```bash
/understand
```

A multi-agent pipeline scans your project, extracts every file, function, class, and dependency, then builds a knowledge graph saved to `.understand-anything/knowledge-graph.json`.

### 3. Explore the dashboard

```bash
/understand-dashboard
```

An interactive web dashboard opens with your codebase visualized as a graph — color-coded by architectural layer, searchable, and clickable. Select any node to see its code, relationships, and a plain-English explanation.

### 4. Keep learning

```bash
# Ask anything about the codebase
/understand-chat How does the payment flow work?

# Analyze impact of your current changes
/understand-diff

# Deep-dive into a specific file or function
/understand-explain src/auth/login.ts

# Generate an onboarding guide for new team members
/understand-onboard

# Extract business domain knowledge (domains, flows, steps)
/understand-domain

# Analyze a Karpathy-pattern LLM wiki knowledge base
/understand-knowledge ~/path/to/wiki
```

## 🌐 Multi-Platform Installation

Understand-Anything works across multiple AI coding platforms.

### Claude Code (Native)

```bash
/plugin marketplace add Lum1104/Understand-Anything
/plugin install understand-anything
```

### One-line install (Codex / OpenCode / OpenClaw / Antigravity / Gemini CLI / Pi Agent / Vibe CLI / VS Code Copilot)

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lum1104/Understand-Anything/main/install.sh | bash
# or skip the prompt by passing the platform:
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lum1104/Understand-Anything/main/install.sh | bash -s codex
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lum1104/Understand-Anything/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

The installer clones the repo to `~/.understand-anything/repo` and creates the right symlinks for the chosen platform. Restart your CLI/IDE afterwards.

- Supported `<platform>` values: `gemini`, `codex`, `opencode`, `pi`, `openclaw`, `antigravity`, `vibe`, `vscode`
- Update later: `./install.sh --update`
- Uninstall: `./install.sh --uninstall <platform>`

### Cursor

Cursor auto-discovers the plugin via `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` when this repo is cloned. No manual installation needed — just clone and open in Cursor.

### VS Code + GitHub Copilot

VS Code with GitHub Copilot (v1.108+) auto-discovers the plugin via `.copilot-plugin/plugin.json` when this repo is cloned. No manual installation needed — just clone and open in VS Code.

For personal skills (available across all projects), run the `install.sh` above with the `vscode` platform.

### Copilot CLI

```bash
copilot plugin install Lum1104/Understand-Anything:understand-anything-plugin
```

### Platform Compatibility

| Platform | Status | Install Method |
|----------|--------|----------------|
| Claude Code | ✅ Native | Plugin marketplace |
| Cursor | ✅ Supported | Auto-discovery |
| VS Code + GitHub Copilot | ✅ Supported | Auto-discovery |
| Copilot CLI | ✅ Supported | Plugin install |
| Codex | ✅ Supported | `install.sh codex` |
| OpenCode | ✅ Supported | `install.sh opencode` |
| OpenClaw | ✅ Supported | `install.sh openclaw` |
| Antigravity | ✅ Supported | `install.sh antigravity` |
| Gemini CLI | ✅ Supported | `install.sh gemini` |
| Pi Agent | ✅ Supported | `install.sh pi` |
| Vibe CLI | ✅ Supported | `install.sh vibe` |

## 📦 Share the Graph with Your Team

The graph is just JSON — **commit it once, and teammates skip the pipeline**. Good for onboarding, PR reviews, and docs-as-code.

> **Example:** [GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo (fork)](https://github.com/Lum1104/microservices-demo) — Go / Java / Python / Node reference with a committed graph.

**What to commit:** everything in `.understand-anything/` *except* `intermediate/` and `diff-overlay.json` (those are local scratch).

```gitignore
.understand-anything/intermediate/
.understand-anything/diff-overlay.json
```

**Keep it fresh:** enable `/understand --auto-update` — a post-commit hook incrementally patches the graph so each commit lands with a matching graph. Or re-run `/understand` manually before releases.

**Large graphs (10 MB+):** track with **git-lfs**.

```bash
git lfs install
git lfs track ".understand-anything/*.json"
git add .gitattributes .understand-anything/
```

## 🔧 Under the Hood

### Multi-Agent Pipeline

The `/understand` command orchestrates 5 specialized agents, and `/understand-domain` adds a 6th:

| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| `project-scanner` | Discover files, detect languages and frameworks |
| `file-analyzer` | Extract functions, classes, imports; produce graph nodes and edges |
| `architecture-analyzer` | Identify architectural layers |
| `tour-builder` | Generate guided learning tours |
| `graph-reviewer` | Validate graph completeness and referential integrity (runs inline by default; use `--review` for full LLM review) |
| `domain-analyzer` | Extract business domains, flows, and process steps (used by `/understand-domain`) |
| `article-analyzer` | Extract entities, claims, and implicit relationships from wiki articles (used by `/understand-knowledge`) |

File analyzers run in parallel (up to 5 concurrent, 20-30 files per batch). Supports incremental updates — only re-analyzes files that changed since the last run.
